# **leftpad-rs**

Why bother making your own left padding function in like 2 minutes when you can instead download this awesome library that gives you the most **ðŸ”¥ blazingly fast ðŸ”¥** left-padding code out there. Want to use TypeScript? You can! thanks to the amazing work the folks over at [napi-rs](https://napi.rs/) do!

If you haven't already, first [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), since this package relies on a rust binary to deliver those indredulously quick leftpads.

Install this package like so:

```bash
npm install @leftpad-rs/core
```

To use it, simply write:

```js
import { leftpad } from "@leftpad-rs/core";

console.log(leftpad("Hello World!", 5));
//     Hello World!
```

The function takes in three arguments:

- **input (required)**: The string to leftpad
- **length (required)**: The number of spaces to leftpad by, must be a positive number
- pattern: The pattern to repeat by, default is a whitespace " ", can be any string
